// You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

// Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

// Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"

// Output: "cbad"

// Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".

// Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

// Example 2:

// Input: order = "bcafg", s = "abcd"


class Solution {
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) freq[c - 'a']++;

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (char c : order.toCharArray()) {
            while (freq[c - 'a']-- > 0) sb.append(c);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            while (freq[i]-- > 0) sb.append((char) (i + 'a'));
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}


Output: "bcad"
